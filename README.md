Simple algorithms in javascript for learning purposes.

To run the examples you need nodejs installed and running:
```
node selection.js
node insertion.js
node quik.js
```
Also quik.js was copied from https://www.codegrepper.com/app/profile.php?id=216760

I found it a good example of how JavaScript allows for a lot of liberties, but code can be unmaintanable unless you maintain it yourself.
